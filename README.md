# Nox

Nox is an AI learning companion for Obsidian. It keeps explanation,
practice, review, and safe Markdown editing beside the note you are working on.

Nox is agent-runtime agnostic at the product boundary. The current runtime
adapter uses the AGY CLI, while the UI and Learning OS flow depend on the
normalized agent contract rather than provider-specific stream events.

## What Nox does

- Uses the current selection or active note as explicit context.
- Streams answers into an Obsidian sidebar.
- Supports Ask, Explain, Practice, Review, and Edit learning actions.
- Tracks evidence-backed learning state in the vault.
- Shows proposed Markdown changes before applying them.
- Applies approved edits through Obsidian APIs so editor state and undo remain
  available.
- Persists sessions and model preferences locally in the plugin data.

## Requirements

- Obsidian desktop `1.4.0` or newer.
- Node.js and `pnpm` for development.
- A configured agent runtime. The current adapter expects the AGY CLI to be
  available on `PATH`, or at an absolute path configured in Nox settings.

## Setup

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run verify
```

Open the plugin settings in Obsidian and configure **Agent executable** if the
runtime is not discoverable on `PATH`. **Preferred model** may be left blank to
use the runtime default.

The runtime can also be selected through the `AGY_PATH` environment variable.
Restart Obsidian after changing environment variables.

## Development commands

```sh
pnpm run dev               # watch the plugin bundle
pnpm run typecheck         # TypeScript check
pnpm run test:unit         # deterministic unit and state tests
pnpm run test:integration  # process, deploy, and boundary tests
pnpm run build             # production artifacts in dist/
pnpm run test:artifacts    # verify plugin identity and artifact contents
pnpm run verify            # complete local verification gate
```

`dist/` is generated output. Do not edit it directly.

## Deploy to a local vault

Build and copy the generated plugin into an Obsidian vault with:

```sh
pnpm run deploy "C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Vault"
```

The deploy command targets `.obsidian/plugins/nox-obsidian`, copies the
contents of `dist/`, and can update the vault's community plugin list. It does
not modify a vault unless a vault path is explicitly provided or configured
through `OBSIDIAN_VAULT`.

## Product flow

```text
selection or current note
        ↓
user intent
        ↓
Learning OS action
  ask / explain / practice / review / edit
        ↓
streamed response or practice state
        ↓
evidence-backed learning update
        ↓
optional proposed Markdown edit
        ↓
user review → Apply or Reject
```

Nox treats context as visible input, recommendations as proposals, and file
changes as user-approved mutations. A normal question is not treated as proof
of mastery; learning progress requires meaningful evidence.

## Architecture

Current implementation:

```text
ChatView
  ↓
LearningController
  ├── ContextResolver
  ├── PolicyLoader
  ├── VaultLearningStore
  ├── MutationService
  └── SessionController
          ↓
      AgentAdapter
          ↓
      AgyAdapter → AGY CLI
```

The canonical target boundaries and incremental migration path live in
`.agents/ENGINEERING_DESIGN.md`.

Provider protocol parsing stays behind the agent adapter boundary. The UI
consumes normalized learning events and never renders raw provider JSON.

## Canonical design and engineering context

- `AGENTS.md` — development workflow and shipping rules.
- `.agents/PRODUCT_DESIGN.md` — product behavior, flows, states, scope, and acceptance criteria.
- `DESIGN.md` — detailed UI/visual system.
- `.agents/ENGINEERING_DESIGN.md` — architecture, boundaries, state ownership, testing, and migration direction.

Keep changes small, preserve one owner per rule, verify the actual risky
boundary, and run the relevant repository gates before shipping.
